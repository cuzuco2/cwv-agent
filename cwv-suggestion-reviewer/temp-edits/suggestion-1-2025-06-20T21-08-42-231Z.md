## Title
Modified! Eagerly Load the LCP Image in the Carousel Block

## Description
The main hero image, which is the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element, is part of a JavaScript-driven carousel. Its loading is delayed because the JavaScript for the carousel runs before the image is prioritized for download. This adds a delay of over 800ms. The most effective solution is to modify the carousel's JavaScript to identify the first slide and immediately prioritize its image, ensuring the browser discovers and starts downloading the LCP image as early as possible.

## Priority
<!-- Options: High, Medium, Low -->
High

## Effort  
<!-- Options: Easy, Medium, Hard -->
Easy

## Expected Impact
800ms - 1000ms reduction

## Implementation Details
Update the `/blocks/carousel/carousel.js` file. In the function that decorates or builds the slides, add a condition to check for the first slide (`slideIndex === 0`) and explicitly set `loading='eager'` and `fetchpriority='high'` on its `<img>` element.

## Code Example
```
// File: /blocks/carousel/carousel.js
// Example modification within the carousel's decoration logic

// inside the loop or logic that creates/processes slides
if (slideIndex === 0) { // Or other condition to identify the first slide
  const img = slide.querySelector('img');
  if (img) {
    // Force the LCP image to load eagerly
    img.loading = 'eager';
    img.fetchPriority = 'high';
  }
}
```
